# ansunit

## Overview

**Ansunit** is a declarative testing framework for [answer set programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) (ASP). In particular, it targets the ASP tools from the [Potassco](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/) project. Test suite descriptions are defined in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) syntax, and they are executed within Python's [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) framework.

## Usage
Install using `pip install ansunit`, then use the provided `ansunit` script on
the command like:

    $ ansunit tests.yaml

## Concepts
A test suite specification is a nested object definition in which important key names start with the word `Test`. Basic test specifications may define a **program** (a body of AnsProlog code), solver **arguments** (passed on the command line), and define an **expectation** for the result of running the program (regarding its satisfiability). Complex test specifications may make use of reusable **modules** described in a **definitions** specification. Tags and other test metadata may be included in the test name itself.

### Test Keywords
- `Test ...` defines a subtest
- `Program` defines a literal piece of code (childen override parents)
- `Expect` defines an outcome (`SAT`, `UNSAT`, or `OPTIMAL`)
- `Arguments` defines a list of string arguments
- `Definitions` defines a *mapping* from module names to definitions
- `Modules` defines a *list* of modules that will participate in the test

### Module Keywords
A module may be defined as...

- `some. inline. code.` (a YAML string)
- `{filename: foo.lp}`
- `{reference: another_module}`
- `{group: [module_a, module_b]}`


## Syntax

This simple specification defines two basic tests in canonical form (all details defined at the leaves of the specification).

```yaml
Test a implies b:
    Program: |
        b :- a.
        a.
        :- not b.
    Expect: SAT

Test b not implies a:
    Program: |
        b :- a.
        b.
        :- not a.
    Expect: UNSAT
```

This complex specification defines four test cases (three of which are grouped into a common suite). A `Definitions` section defines several modules with complex indirect references that are to be used later. In the second test (suite) several variations on a common test setup are defined concisely by means of inheriting details defined in the enclosing suite. Now shown, it is also possible to define all details including `Modules`, `Arguments`, and even `Program` at the top level for use by inheritance.

```yaml
Definitions:
    foo: {filename: foo.lp}
    bar: {filename: bar.lp}
    both: {group: [instance, encoding]}
    instance: {reference: bar}
    inline: |
        #const width = 3.
        dim(1..width).
        { p(X) } :- dim(X).


Test twisted references:
    Definitions:
        encoding: {reference: foo}
    Modules: both
    Expect: SAT

Test inline various:
    Modules: inline
    Expect: SAT

    Test small:
        Arguments: -c width=1 

    Test medium:
        Arguments: -c width=3 

    Test large:
        Arguments: -c width=5
```

## Command line arguments
Run `ansunit --help` for more information.

## Working with large test suites

Use the `-m` and `-n` (`--filter_match` and `--filter_nomatch`) arguments to
select a focused subset of tests to run. A test is selected if it matches all
positve conditions and no negative conditions. Conditions are checked by running
`re.search` on the whole test name -- the strings with `::`.

For the `demo_complex.yaml` suite above, we might select tests in the `various`
sweet excluding the `large` test with a command like this (using `-l` to list
tests matching the conditions rather than executing them):

    $ ansunit complex.yaml -m various -n large
    - Test complex.yaml :: inline various :: large
    * Test complex.yaml :: inline various :: medium
    * Test complex.yaml :: inline various :: small
    - Test complex.yaml :: twisted references
